<h2>Database setup</h2>

We are using a Postgres database that have three tables set up as follow:

<h3>Users:</h3>
    <p class="indent">username character varying(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL,<br>
    password character varying(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL,<br>
    userid serial PRIMARY KEY,<br>
    leaning integer,<br>
    email character varying(200) UNIQUE NOT NULL</p>
<h3>Articles:</h3>
    <p>articleid serial PRIMARY KEY,<br>
    title character varying(500) NOT NULL,<br>
    url character varying(500) NOT NULL,<br>
    author character varying(500),<br>
    description character varying(500),<br>
    publishedat character varying(500),<br>
    source character varying(500),<br>
    urltoimage character varying(500),<br>
    topic character varying(500)</p>
<h3>Ratings:</h3>
    <p>ratingid serial PRIMARY KEY,<br>
    userid integer,<br>
    articleid integer,<br>
    fair integer,<br>
    unfair integer,<br>
    newsworthy integer,<br>
    not_newsworthy integer</p>
    
<h2>Restful API format</h2>
<h3>GET</h3>
<h4>Full tables</h4>
<p>To retrieve JSON of entire database tables, make GET request at location:</p>
<h6>localhost:3000/{insert_table}</h6>
<p>Optional tables are <em>users</em>, <em>articles</em>, and <em>ratings</em> (listed in the database section)</p>
<h5>An example return of GET request to localhost:3000/users :</h5>
<p>[{"username":"rfpoulos","password":"newTestPassword","userid":6,"leaning":80,"email":"rfpoulos@outlook.com"},{"username":"rfpoulos2","password":"test","userid":7,"leaning":75,"email":"rfpoulos2@outlook.com"}]</p>
<h4>Individual entries</h4>
<p>For individual entries in each table, send GET request to:</p>
<h6>localhost:3000/{insert_table}/{insert_id#}</h6>
<p>For example localhost:3000/users/6 will return the entire column of the user with the serial id 6.  Same for articles and ratings.
<h5>An example return of GET request to localhost:3000/users/6 :</h5>
<p>[{"username":"rfpoulos","password":"newTestPassword","userid":6,"leaning":80,"email":"rfpoulos@outlook.com"}]</p>
<h3>POST</h3>
<p>POST requests can be done to each of the three tables in the following format</p>
<h6>localhost:3000/{insert_table}</h6>
<p>The sent object <strong><em>must</em></strong> have all of the NOT NULL values as listed in the datatables section.  Otherwise, the value is optional.</p>
<h5>Examples of acceptable POST user objects</h5>
<p>{"username":"rfpoulos2","password":"test", "leaning":75,"email":"rfpoulos2@outlook.com"}</p>
<p><strong>OR</strong> {"username":"rfpoulos2","password":"test", "email":"rfpoulos2@outlook.com"} because the "leaning" attribute is not required by the PSQL database.</p>
<h3>PUT</h3>
<p>A PUT request for any of the tables can be done to the following address:</p>
<h6>localhost:3000/{insert_table}/{insert_id#}</h6>
<p>The JSON package with it only needs the values that need to be updated.  For example, lets say you want to update the following user object:</p>
<h6>{"username":"rfpoulos","password":"newTestPassword","userid":6,"leaning":80,"email":"rfpoulos@outlook.com"}</h6>
<p>You would send a PUT request to localhost:3000/users/6 with a JSON object that just contained the values you wanted to change.  Lets say just the e-mail and password.  You would send the following object:</p>
<h6>{"email": "new-email@email.com", "password": "betterPassword"}</h6>
<p>Now a GET request to localhost:3000/users/6 would reflect the following:</p>
<h6>{"username":"rfpoulos","password":<strong>"betterPassword"</strong>,"userid":6,"leaning":80,"email":<strong>"rfpoulos@outlook.com"}</strong></h6>
<h3>DELETE</h3>
<p>To delete a column in any database, send a DELETE request to the following location:</p>
<h6>localhost:3000/{insert_table}/{insert_id#}</h6>
